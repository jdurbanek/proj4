1. The error is lowest when connected to the sampus wireless network while being
on campus. This is because the university is its own ISP, so the location
associated with the IP address is the location of the campus itself.
2. The error is highest whie being connected to a cellular network. This is
because a cellular network tend to span a large area, usually country-wide, so
there is little correlation between the actual location of the client and the IP
address.
